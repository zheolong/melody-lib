# Note: This mapfile is used to place r_debug as the
# very first data item inside of the run-time linker.
# This is required for the ld.so.1 <--> rtld_db bootstraping
# for debuggers.
#
# The issue with this is that gcc/devpro do not agree on the
# name of the section this data should be placed in.  So -
# we must have a mapfile for each.
#
# If you update this file - make sure you update
# the matching file:
