/*
 * Please take careful note.  It turns out that the _ISxxx macros
 * occupy the lower order byte, except for _ISGRAPH, _ISALPHA, and _ISPRINT.
 * Those occupt 0x2000, 0x4000, and 0x8000.  Now, noting *very* carefully,
 * it turns out that this leaves some gaps in the extended bits, which
 * are occupied by _E1 = phonogram, _E2 = ideogram, and _E3 = English.
 * The *other* _Ex bits are reserved.  We don't think these higher order
 * bits are baked into applications (because they haven't been used before),
 * so we believe it is safe to reuse them how we see fit.
 *
 * This makes it possible to define a single space which overlaps both the
 * wctype types, and the ctype types.
