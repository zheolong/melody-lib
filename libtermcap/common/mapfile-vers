$mapfile_version 2

#
# This is a mapfile that defines a filter for libcurses so that
# libraries such as libreadline can link with this and NOT force
# the choice of which curses library will be used.  The NODIRECT
# flag lets other libraries earlier in the link order provide the
# symbols below, in which case those will be used by all calls
# to these functions _instead_ of the libcurses ones.  Cool, eh?
